# Strategy

![Strategy Overview Diagram](diagrams/strategy_overview.digraph.svg)

## Overview

The strategy is defined as triangular arbitrage. The Controller continuously scans for arbitrage opportunities using data sources such as the PancakeSwap v3 API to fetch token prices and other relevant information. When a profitable trade is identified, it triggers the smart contract defined in FlashLoanArbitrage.sol to execute the trade. The smart contract interacts with the AAVE Flash Loan Provider to borrow funds and the PancakeSwap v3 DEX to swap Token A for Token B and then Token B for Token C, and finally back to Token A. The smart contract ensures that the flash loan is repaid within the same transaction and retains the profit after covering the loan and transaction fees.

## Components

### Controller

* The Controller is responsible for scanning the PancakeSwap v3 API for arbitrage opportunities.
* It interacts with the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) using QuickNode.
* It triggers the smart contract to execute the trade when a profitable opportunity is identified.
* The Controller is deployed on a server to run continuously.

#### Identify Arbitrage Opportunities

The Controller continuously scans for profitable arbitrage opportunities by analyzing token prices across trading pairs on PancakeSwap v3. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Fetch Real-Time Data**:
   * Use PancakeSwap v3's API to retrieve the latest prices for relevant token pairs (e.g., Token A/B and Token B/C).

2. **Analyze Price Discrepancies**:
   * Compare the prices of token pairs to identify potential arbitrage opportunities.
   * Calculate the expected profit for each identified opportunity.

3. **Evaluate Profitability**:
   * Consider transaction fees, slippage, and other factors to determine the net profit.
   * Filter out opportunities that do not meet the profitability threshold.

4. **Log Opportunities**:
   * Record all identified arbitrage opportunities with details such as token pairs, expected profit, and execution parameters.
   * Use this data for performance analysis and system optimization.

5. **Trigger Execution**:
   * If a profitable opportunity is identified, the Controller calls the smart contract to execute the trade atomically.

### FlashLoanArbitrage.sol

* It uses PancakeSwap v3 as the DEX, and the AAVE flash loan provider to borrow funds.
* The smart contract is deployed on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).
* Profit is retained by the smart contract after repaying the flash loan.
* The transaction fails if the profit is not sufficient to cover the flash loan and transaction fees.

### DEX

* PancakeSwap v3 is the DEX of choice for this system. It has substantial liquidity and trading volume, making it a good platform for arbitrage opportunities.
* PancakeSwap v3 is deployed on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which offers low transaction fees and fast confirmation times.
* The structured liquidity distribution in **bin pools** offers more consistent liquidity across price ranges. This consistency can facilitate smoother execution of arbitrage trades, reducing the risk of slippage and enhancing the strategyâ€™s effectiveness.

### AAVE Flash Loan Provider

* AAVE is used as the flash loan provider for this system.
* Flash loans allow borrowing funds without collateral, provided the loan is repaid within the same transaction.
* AAVE charges a fee for flash loans, which is deducted from the profit generated by the arbitrage trade.
